## Test Case Generation

You are acting as a QA engineer. Generate a complete set of test cases from the UI screen specification the user has provided or currently has open.

### Step 1 — Read required files

Before generating anything, read the following files in order:

1. The UI screen specification file the user indicated (or the currently open spec file).
2. Every spec file listed under **Related Views → Spec File** in that specification. Read each one fully to understand its view ID, components, fields, validations, and flow.
3. `vars.md` at the root of the project. Extract the `BASE_URL` value — this is the domain prepended to every route defined in spec files when constructing full URLs in preconditions and steps.

---

### Step 2 — Apply the specification conventions

All output must follow the conventions defined in `TEMPLATE.md`. Apply them exactly.

**Field references**
- Reference every field, input, button, link, or interactive element using its `${field-name}` placeholder as defined in the spec.
- Never substitute `${field-name}` with a concrete value inside test cases.
- When a field belongs to a related view (not the current one), prefix it with its source view ID: `<<view-id>>.${field-name}`.

**View references**
- Reference every view using its `<<view-id>>` identifier as defined in the spec.

**Full URL construction**
- Construct full URLs in preconditions and navigation steps as: `BASE_URL` + `Route` from the spec.
- Example: `BASE_URL=https://app.example.com` + `/login` → `https://app.example.com/login`.

---

### Step 3 — Determine coverage

Generate the optimal number of test cases for complete behavioral coverage. Do not use a fixed count per category — let the complexity of the spec determine it. Do not assume or invent behavior not explicitly described.

Cover every applicable test type:

- **Happy Path** — the main successful flow from entry to final state
- **Smoke** — minimum critical checks that confirm the view is functional
- **Functional** — detailed validation of each component, field rule, state transition, business rule, and action in the spec
- **Edge Case** — boundary conditions, empty states, max/min values, and unusual but valid interactions
- **Exploratory** — scenarios implied by the spec holistically that are not explicitly listed but follow logically from the described behavior

Specifically ensure coverage of:
- Every field validation inside every component
- Every component-level validation
- Every validation defined on view-level fields
- Every named screen state and its transition conditions
- Every business rule — both the met path and the violated path
- Every action and its expected reaction
- Every cross-view scenario from the **Related Views** section — each cross-view test must be fully self-contained, starting with the setup steps in the related view and ending with the assertion in the current view
- For **External Service** entries: do not test the service directly; generate a test case that stubs or mocks it and asserts the expected behavior of the current view

---

### Step 4 — Produce Artifact 1: test-cases.md

Write a file named `test-cases.md` in the same directory as the spec file, using the structure below. Each test case must reference fields and views using placeholders only — never concrete values.

```
# Test Cases — <<view-id>>

## [TC-001] (Title)

- **Type**: Happy Path | Smoke | Functional | Edge Case | Exploratory
- **Description**: (One sentence describing what this test validates)
- **Preconditions**: (Required state, session, data, or navigation before the test begins. Use <<view-id>> for views and ${field-name} for field values. Include the full URL when navigation is required. Omit this block if there are no preconditions.)
- **Steps**:
  1. (Action — use ${field-name} for every interaction, <<view-id>> for every navigation)
  2. (...)
- **Expected Result**: (What the system must do or display)
```

Repeat the block for each test case.

---

### Step 5 — Produce Artifact 2: test-data.md

After writing `test-cases.md`, write a second file named `test-data.md` in the same directory. This is a standalone fillable document — it contains only data, never test logic.

Rules:
- Organize by scenario using the same TC IDs and titles from Artifact 1.
- Under each scenario, group fields by their source view using `<<view-id>>` as a section header.
- List every `${field-name}` referenced in the test case under the correct view section, with an empty fill-in slot.
- Preserve the exact `${field-name}` identifiers from the spec — do not rename or alias them.
- Include only test cases that require input data; omit test cases with no field interactions.

```
# Test Data — <<view-id>>

## [TC-001] (Title)

### <<view-id>>
- ${field-name}: 
- ${field-name}: 

### <<related-view-id>>
- ${field-name}: 
- ${field-name}: 

## [TC-002] (Title)

### <<view-id>>
- ${field-name}: 
```

Repeat for each test case that requires input data.

---

### Step 6 — Report completion

Once both files are written, report:
- Path to `test-cases.md` and total number of test cases generated, broken down by type.
- Path to `test-data.md` and total number of scenarios included.
- Any related view spec files that were read and incorporated into cross-view test cases.
- Any assumptions made due to ambiguity in the spec (if any).
